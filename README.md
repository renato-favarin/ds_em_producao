This project was inspired by the "Rossmann Store Sales" challenge published on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales)

Here is the business scenario: the sales director of the Rossmann stores wants to estimate the sales forecast for the next 6 weeks on its different units spread across Europe 

The resolution of the challenge was carried out following the CRISP (Cross-industry standard process for data mining) methodology, which is a cyclical approach that streamlines the delivery of value.

The first step was to understand the data; soon after, the cleaning of the database and treatment of missing values began.

The next step was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). But right before that, a mental map of hypotheses was made in order to guide EDA, generate insights and understand a little more about the database and the most important attributes. For some hypotheses it was necessary to derive new features from the existing ones.
